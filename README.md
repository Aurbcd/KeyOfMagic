Key of Magic is a rogue-like adventure game. It will challenge your keyboard dexterity, since your only way to attack is to type your spells. Explore a donjon full of monsters, bosses, items and mysteries. Your reflexes and your ability to adapt will be key to defeat the randomly generated levels of this game.

In Key of Magic, you are a magician student, and it’s the D-Day: your final exam is here! Throw yourself in this trial side by side with Bob, your beloved familiar. Even if you forgot to study, it’s never too late. Learning by doing has always been your greatest asset.
